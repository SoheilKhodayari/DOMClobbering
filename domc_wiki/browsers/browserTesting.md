## Browser Testing for DOM Clobbering

Please refer to the online [browser testing service]() to test your browser against DOM Clobbering markups.


New DOM Clobbering markups can be discovered in web browsers by running the [offline browser testing tool](https://github.com/SoheilKhodayari/DOMClobbering/tree/master/backend). The source code of the tests can be found [here](https://github.com/SoheilKhodayari/DOMClobbering/tree/master/domc_tests).
