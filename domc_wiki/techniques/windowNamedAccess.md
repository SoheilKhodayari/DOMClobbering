## Named Access on the Window Object

These group of markups leverage a single HTML element whose `id` or `name`is set to a target variable `x`, clobbering `window.x` due to browsersâ€™ compliance with the [Named Access on the Window Object](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/window-object.html#named-access-on-the-window-object) rule.

**Note.** We can use `window.x` and `x` interchangeably because all global variables belong to the global `Window` object by default.



**Cause.** The [Window](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/window-object.html#window) object supports [named properties](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#dfn-support-named-properties). This means that it is possible to reference DOM elements through `Window` with their named property, i.e., `id` or `name` attribute value in the DOM tree.

**Example.** consider the following `anchor` node:

```html
<a id="x" href="https://example.com">
```

The `Window` object supporting named properties means it is possible to reference this element with `window.x` where `x` is the id of the `anchor` tag.
