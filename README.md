# DOM Clobbering Browser Testing Framework

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/boennemann/badges.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/boennemann/badges) [![Node](https://img.shields.io/badge/node%40latest-%3E%3D%206.0.0-brightgreen.svg)](https://img.shields.io/badge/node%40latest-%3E%3D%206.0.0-brightgreen.svg) [![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/) [![Open Source?Yes!](https://badgen.net/badge/Open%20Source%20%3F/Yes%21/blue?icon=github)](https://github.com/Naereen/badges/)

A comprehensive framework for testing web browsers against DOM Clobbering. DOMC-BT exhaustively generates test cases of candidate DOM Clobbering markups and automatically tests them against web browsers. 

DOMC-BT complements [`TheThing`](https://github.com/SoheilKhodayari/TheThing) a static-dynamic security analysis tool for DOM clobbering based on [JAW](https://soheilkhodayari.github.io/JAW/).

DOMC-BT has a website available at [https://domclob.xyz](https://domclob.xyz).

## üöÄ Browser Testing


### üè≠ Building 

You can build the tool by:

```bash
$ docker-compose build web
$ docker-compose build browserstack
```


### üî• Running Tests in Your Browser

Run the web application that serves the test DOM Clobbering webpages:
```bash
$ docker-compose up web
```

Now, you should be able to visit the list of tests on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`, and run any of them in your browser by clicking on the links.

**Note:** The test pages automatically redirect to the next test webpage, therefore clicking the first test is sufficinet to run all the test cases.


### üé° Running Tests via BrowserStack

You can use [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) to run the DOM clobbering testsuite for many browsers simultaneously.

**Step 1:** specify the browser configurations you would like to test in `.json` file. See [here](https://www.browserstack.com/automate/capabilities) for more information about available list of browsers. You can find an example in [browser_capabilities.json](browser_capabilities.json) in the root project directory.

**Step 2:** Run the webapp hosting the test pages, and setup a proxy so that BrowserStack can access this webapp:
``` bash
$ docker-compose up web
$ ./browserstack_proxy ACCOUNT_KEY
```

**Note:** In the above command, replace `ACCOUNT_KEY` with your `BrowserStack` [access key](https://www.browserstack.com/docs/iaam/security/manage-access-keys).

**Note:** For setting up the proxy, you may need to download the appropriate `BrowserStack` [binary](https://www.browserstack.com/docs/local-testing/releases-and-downloads) and rename it to `BrowserStackLocal`. For more information, refer to the officail BrowserStack local testing [documentation](https://www.browserstack.com/docs/local-testing).


**Step 3:** Run the automated docker service called `browserstack` to execute the tests:

``` bash
$ docker-compose up browserstack
```



## ‚û∞ DOM Clobbering Markups

The data of the DOM Clobbering markups are available in the [`domc_markups`](./domc_markups) folder in the root project directory for different  `mobile` and `desktop` browsers and browser versions



## üìö DOM Clobbering Wiki

This repository features one of the first online wikis for DOM Clobbering accessible at [https://domclob.xyz](https://domclob.xyz).

The `markdown` files of the wiki are available in the [`domc_wiki`](https://github.com/SoheilKhodayari/DOMClobbering/blob/master/domc_wiki) folder in the project root directory. 


### üè≠ Local Build

This repository uses the Jekyll [just-the-docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) as a GitHub pages [remote theme](https://blog.github.com/2017-11-29-use-any-theme-with-github-pages/), with the configuration specified in `_config.yaml`:

```
remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs
color_scheme: "dark"
```

**Docker:** You can build and run this Wiki inside a Docker container with:

```
$ docker-compose build wiki
$ docker-compose up wiki
```

**Host Machine:** alternatively, you can build it inside your host machine with:

```
$ gem install just-the-docs
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

For more information, please refer to the official [just-the-docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) documentations. 


### üíª Automatic Deployment

The repository uses [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to automatically build and publish a static version of the DOM Clobbering Wiki with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) once a commit is merged with the `master` branch (i.e., a Pull Request is accepted).



## üôã Questions

For any questions, suggestions, feedback or concerns, please [raise an issue in the repository](https://github.com/SoheilKhodayari/DOMClobbering/issues).
